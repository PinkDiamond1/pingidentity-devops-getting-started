## Running a PingAuthorize container

The easiest way to test a simple standalone image of PingAuthorize is to cut/paste the following command into a terminal on a machine with docker.

```
  docker run \
           --name pingauthorize \
           --publish 1389:389 \
           --publish 8443:443 \
           --detach \
           --env SERVER_PROFILE_URL=https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-server-profiles.git \
           --env SERVER_PROFILE_PATH=getting-started/pingauthorize \
           --env PING_IDENTITY_ACCEPT_EULA=YES \
           --env PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_USER \
           --env PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_KEY \
           --tmpfs /run/secrets \
          pingidentity/pingauthorize:edge
```

You can view the Docker logs with the command:

```
  docker logs -f pingauthorize
```

You should see the ouptut from a PingAuthorize install and configuration, ending with a message the the PingAuthorize has
started.  After it starts, you will see some typical access logs.  Simply ``Ctrl-C`` afer to stop tailing the logs.
