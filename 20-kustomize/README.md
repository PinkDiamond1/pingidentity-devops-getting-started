The examples in this directory are for Kustomize use only. For more information on Kustomize, see [Kubernetes deployments for general use](../docs/deployment/deployK8sGeneral.md).

While configuring environments with Kustomize is possible, Ping Identity recommends using Helm for more complex use cases.

For Helm examples, see the [30-helm directory](../30-helm). For more information on Helm, see [Ping Identity DevOps Helm Charts](https://helm.pingidentity.com).
